"""HTTP upload + download endpoints for chat attachments.

Large file attachments (anything the AI can't read natively — zips,
videos, binaries, big PDFs, …) do NOT round-trip through the WebSocket.
Instead, the frontend uploads the bytes directly via
``POST /api/chat/upload``. This module streams the multipart body to
disk under the conversation's workspace ``uploads/`` directory, returns
a JSON descriptor that becomes a reference-mode ``FileAttachment``,
and the chat frame carries only the workspace coordinates — not the bytes.

On the read side, ``GET /api/chat/download/{conv_id}/{path}`` streams
the file back out from disk.

Both endpoints enforce conversation ownership via the shared
``check_conversation_access`` helper so users can't upload into, or
download from, someone else's chat.
