"""HTTP + WebSocket endpoints Telnyx talks to.

Two pieces:

- ``POST /api/telnyx/webhook`` — call-control event webhook. Telnyx
  POSTs JSON for every status transition (initiated → answered →
  hangup, plus DTMF + streaming.* events). Dispatched to the active
  ``TelnyxWebhookEndpoint`` capability.

- ``WS   /api/telnyx/media``   — bidirectional media stream. Inbound
  frames carry base64-encoded mulaw audio + ``start`` / ``stop`` /
  ``mark`` control events; outbound frames are written by the call
  brain through the session's ``AudioSink``.

This module lives in core ``web/routes/`` because FastAPI route
registration happens at composition time in ``web/__init__.py`` — we
want the routes mounted at fixed paths even if the plugin isn't
loaded yet. All carrier-specific work happens behind the
``telnyx_webhook`` capability so the route stays plugin-agnostic.
