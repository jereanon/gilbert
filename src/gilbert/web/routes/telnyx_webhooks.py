"""HTTP + WebSocket endpoints Telnyx talks to.

Two pieces:

- ``POST /api/telnyx/webhook`` — call-control event webhook. Telnyx
  POSTs JSON for every status transition (initiated → answered →
  hangup, plus DTMF + streaming.* events). Routed into the matching
  ``_TelnyxCallSession`` via the plugin's registry.

- ``WS   /api/telnyx/media``   — bidirectional media stream. Inbound
  frames carry base64-encoded mulaw audio + ``start`` / ``stop`` /
  ``mark`` control events; outbound frames are written by the call
  brain through the session's ``AudioSink``.

This module deliberately lives in core ``web/routes/`` rather than the
telnyx plugin because:

- FastAPI route registration happens in ``web/__init__.py`` and we want
  the routes mounted at fixed paths even if the plugin's not loaded yet
  (Telnyx might POST to the webhook before plugin init finishes during
  a restart).
- The plugin's module is imported via the loader, but FastAPI's `app`
  is constructed earlier in startup — easier to mount routes from the
  composition root than to plumb the app handle into the plugin.

The functions still do all their real work through the plugin's
registry helpers (``find_session_by_*``, ``deliver_webhook_event``),
keeping the carrier semantics on the plugin side.
