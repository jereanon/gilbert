"""Voice-brain service — the reusable conversation-loop engine.

Drives any bidirectional voice conversation Gilbert is in. Originally
extracted from the phone-call service's ``_run_call`` brain; the same
engine now powers (or will power) any modality that needs to:

1. Listen to inbound audio.
2. Run that audio through STT.
3. Drive an LLM turn-by-turn with a configurable brain-tool catalog.
4. Speak the LLM's reply back via TTS, pacing chunks at carrier rate.
5. Barge-out the TTS the moment the user starts talking (local VAD).

Phone calls are the canonical first consumer. The voice-agent /
wake-word plugin will be the second. The engine doesn't know about
either — it consumes a ``ConversationSession`` (modality-specific
audio I/O + events), a ``ConversationConfig`` (system prompt, opening
policy, brain-tool provider, observability callbacks), and returns a
``ConversationOutcome``.

This module deliberately contains no carrier code, no persistence, no
chat-poster code. All that lives in the wrappers that call into the
engine. The split is concrete enough that a wrapper that doesn't
persist anything (an ephemeral voice prompt, say) is just a wrapper
with no-op callbacks.
