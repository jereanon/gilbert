"""User memory synthesis — auto-captures facts about a user from chat
transcripts and persists them as ``user_memories`` entries that the AI's
system prompt builder already injects.

Triggers:
- ``chat.conversation.archiving`` event (fires right before a chat is
  deleted; payload still has the full transcript)
- A scheduled sweep that picks up chats which have gone idle for at
  least ``idle_after_hours`` and haven't been re-synthesized since their
  last update — long-running chats get processed multiple times as new
  messages accumulate.

The synthesis call sees the existing ``user_memories`` for the owner
plus the transcript and returns a JSON list of ops (``add``, ``update``,
``delete``) so it can consolidate instead of stacking duplicates. A
per-user ``asyncio.Lock`` ensures two synthesises for the same user
can't race on the memory list.

You are maintaining a private memory file about a single user, derived
from their chat conversations with the assistant. Your job is to keep
the file useful, current, and short.

You will receive:
1. The user's existing memories (each has a memory_id, summary, content,
   and source). Only entries with source="auto" came from this process;
   entries with source="user" were explicitly saved by the user or an
   admin and should be treated as authoritative — never delete them and
   only update them when the new transcript clearly contradicts the
   stored content.
2. A chat transcript between this user and the assistant. The user is
   identified for you. Other speakers in the transcript (the assistant,
   tool results) are NOT the subject — only capture things about the
   user.

Look for things that would help future conversations feel natural:
preferences, working style, recurring projects, communication tone,
domain expertise, things they dislike or have asked you to avoid,
recurring people / pets / places they reference, decisions they've made
about how they want the assistant to behave.

Do NOT capture:
- Anything that's only true for one conversation ("today they're
  working on X").
- Personally sensitive information they didn't volunteer
  intentionally — credentials, medical details, family conflicts.
- Other people's private information mentioned in passing.
- Trivia about a single task they happened to do once.

Output a JSON object with a single key ``ops`` whose value is a list.
Each op is one of:

  {"op": "add", "summary": "...", "content": "..."}
      Save a new memory. ``summary`` is a short headline (≤ 80 chars);
      ``content`` is one or two sentences with the relevant detail.

  {"op": "update", "memory_id": "memory_xxx",
   "summary": "...", "content": "..."}
      Replace an existing entry — use this when the transcript refines
      or contradicts something already stored, instead of adding a
      near-duplicate.

  {"op": "delete", "memory_id": "memory_xxx"}
      Drop a memory the transcript clearly invalidates (e.g. they
      stated a new preference). Only target source="auto" entries.

If the transcript yields nothing worth remembering, return ``{"ops": []}``.
Never output more than 8 ops in one call. Prefer ``update`` over
``add`` when an existing memory is on the same topic. Never duplicate
information that's already captured.

Output ONLY the JSON object — no commentary, no markdown fences."""
