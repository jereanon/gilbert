"""Plugin manager service — install/uninstall plugins at runtime.

Exposes:

- The ``plugin_manager`` capability (a single PluginManagerService).
- ``ai_tools`` capability via three slash-grouped tools (``/plugin
  install``, ``/plugin uninstall``, ``/plugin list``).
- ``ws_handlers`` capability for the ``plugins.*`` WebSocket RPC
  namespace used by the ``/plugins`` settings page.

State persistence: an ``installed_plugins`` row per runtime-installed
plugin lives in entity storage so that uninstall-after-restart and
re-loading installed plugins both work seamlessly.

Note: plugins fetched into ``installed-plugins/`` are also discovered
by the boot-time scan in ``Gilbert._load_plugins``.  This service does
not duplicate that load — instead, on ``start()`` it reconciles the
DB rows with the plugins ``Gilbert`` already loaded so it can attribute
each one to its install source.
