"""Music service interface — browse, search, and resolve playable URIs.

Shaped around what a Sonos-style integration can actually do: list the
user's favorites and saved playlists, search within a linked music service,
and resolve selected items into playable URIs (with optional DIDL metadata
envelopes when the speaker needs them).

The old ID-based ``get_track``/``get_album`` lookups are intentionally
absent — they only made sense for backends that expose a public HTTP API
(like Spotify Web), and Sonos/SMAPI can't look up arbitrary items by ID
without having first seen them in a browse or search call.
