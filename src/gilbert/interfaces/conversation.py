"""Conversation-engine interface — the reusable bidirectional-audio loop.

The conversation engine drives any back-and-forth voice exchange Gilbert is
in: outbound phone calls, wake-word activated local voice sessions,
videoconference participants, etc. The shape mirrors what proved necessary
in the phone-call brain — a session-like audio I/O endpoint, a few status
events, an LLM brain that turn-takes and barges-in, and a pluggable set of
"brain tools" the LLM can call to mutate the conversation's outcome.

This module deliberately contains nothing carrier-, hardware-, or
modality-specific. The phone-call wrapper builds on top of these
abstractions; the eventual voice-agent / wake-word wrapper will too. Each
of them brings their own brain-tool provider, their own session
implementation, and their own opening policy (do we speak first? wait for
the other side?) — the engine just orchestrates.

This file is pure: standard library + the existing ``gilbert.interfaces``
sub-modules only. No core service imports.
