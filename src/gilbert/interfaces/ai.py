    the way they always have, while new callers can use attribute access
    (``result.attachments``) for clarity.

    Fields:

    - ``response_text``: the assistant's final textual reply, already

    - ``conversation_id``: the persistent conversation ID (UUID string).
    - ``ui_blocks``: serialized ``UIBlock`` dicts produced by tool calls

    - ``tool_usage``: per-tool-call summaries for the UI's "what did it
      do" strip. Entries with ``is_error=True`` include the error reason.
    - ``attachments``: files the assistant wants the user to see on this
      turn (tool-produced PDFs, images, spreadsheets, …). May be empty.
      Inline mode carries the bytes; workspace-reference mode carries
      ``(workspace_skill, workspace_path)`` pointing at a file on disk
      that the frontend fetches via ``skills.workspace.download`` when
      the user clicks download.
    - ``rounds``: structured per-round breakdown of the AI's intermediate
      thinking, used by the frontend's turn-bubble UI to render every
      round's reasoning + tool calls in one cohesive card. Each entry
      is ``{reasoning: str, tools: [{tool_call_id, tool_name, arguments,

      above. May be empty for turns that answered in a single round with
      no tool use.
    - ``interrupted``: True when the user stopped the turn mid-flight
      via ``chat.message.cancel``. Partial state (completed rounds,
      the user message, and anything persisted so far) is preserved;
      the frontend renders a subtle "interrupted" indicator on the
      turn bubble so it's clear the answer didn't finish organically.
