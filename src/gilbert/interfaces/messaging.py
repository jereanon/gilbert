"""Messaging backend interface — sending and receiving SMS / chat-style
text messages.

Shape mirrors the other I/O backends (``TelephonyBackend``,
``TTSBackend``, …):

- ABC with ``_registry`` + ``__init_subclass__`` auto-registration so
  the composition root discovers concretes via
  ``MessagingBackend.registered_backends()`` after a side-effect
  import.
- ``backend_config_params()`` declares the keys the operator sets in
  ``/settings`` for the chosen backend.
- ``initialize(config)`` / ``close()`` lifecycle hooks.
- One outbound operation: ``send_message(to, body, *, media_urls=…,
  from_number=…)`` returns the backend-issued message id.

Inbound delivery is push-based — the carrier hits a webhook, the core
``/api/<backend>/messages/webhook`` route resolves a
``<backend>_messaging_webhook`` capability, and the plugin parses the
event and calls back into ``MessagingService.receive_inbound(...)``.
The ABC doesn't need to know about that path; the parsing lives
inside the backend's own plugin code.

This module is pure: only standard library + cross-references inside
``interfaces/``. No HTTP clients, no plugin imports, no service code.
