    ``SpeakerService._audio_url()`` mints absolute URLs targeting the
    server's LAN IP on a hardcoded ``http://`` scheme — fine for Sonos
    (physical LAN device, plain HTTP), broken for a browser that loaded
    Gilbert via HTTPS through a reverse proxy. Symptom in the browser:
    mixed-content block, or HTTPS-upgrade → TLS handshake against a
    plaintext port → ``SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG``.

    This helper strips scheme + host from URLs whose path starts with
    ``/output/`` (the prefix the speaker service uses for transient
    output files). The SPA then resolves the relative path against
    ``window.location.origin`` — whatever scheme + host actually got
    the user to Gilbert.

    External URLs (free-form ``play_audio`` calls pointing at e.g.
    ``https://podcast.example.com/ep.mp3``) are left absolute —
    stripping their host would point them at the SPA origin and break
    them. The ``/output/`` prefix is the heuristic for "ours."

    Lives on ``interfaces/`` so both ``BrowserSpeakerBackend`` (which
    publishes ``speaker.browser.play`` directly) and ``SpeakerService``
    (which fans out to a browser echo when a user has opted in) can
    share one implementation.
