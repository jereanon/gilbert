    The frontend exposes ``<PluginPanelSlot name="...">`` mount points
    on its pages (for example ``account.extensions`` on the Account
    page). Plugins return ``UIPanel`` entries from
    ``Plugin.ui_panels()`` to register a component into one of those
    slots. Core never imports plugin-specific React components — the
    SPA looks up the registered React component by ``panel_id`` in a
    per-plugin side-effect-import file under
    ``frontend/src/plugins/<name>/``, so adding a new plugin's UI is
    a purely additive change.

    - ``panel_id`` — globally unique, conventionally
      ``<plugin>.<panel>`` (e.g. ``browser.credentials``).
    - ``slot`` — the named mount point. Built-in slots include
      ``account.extensions`` (per-user account page) and
      ``settings.<category>`` (admin Settings page, scoped to a
      config category). Pages may declare additional slots over
      time; this dataclass is the source of truth.
    - ``label`` — optional short title shown above the panel.
    - ``description`` — optional one-line description / tooltip.
    - ``required_role`` — minimum role to see the panel
      (``"user"`` / ``"admin"``). The frontend filters server-side
      via the auth context; clients can't request a panel they
      don't qualify for.
    - ``requires_capability`` — gates the panel on a service
      capability being live. Pair with the plugin's own service
      capability so a toggleable service's dashboard panel
      disappears when the user disables it under Services.

      chromium`` writes to a per-user cache). Leave empty for things
